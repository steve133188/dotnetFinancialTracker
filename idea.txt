## 💡 Product Idea

The "Family Budget & Wellbeing Companion" is a cross-platform desktop application designed to help families better manage their daily financial activities, health reminders, and household responsibilities—all in one simple interface.

Built with .NET 8 Blazor Hybrid and styled with **MudBlazor**, this app focuses on being accessible, responsive, and easy to use for all age groups in a household, including elderly members with limited tech experience.

## 🎯 Motivation

Many families in today’s world face two common pain points:

1. **Financial Stress** – caused by lack of visibility in family expenses, savings, and budgets.
2. **Family Member Disconnection** – where responsibilities (such as medication reminders or daily tasks) are not clearly shared.

This app acts as a shared digital assistant that helps:
- Keep track of expenses, bills, and savings goals
- Schedule and complete shared responsibilities (e.g. cleaning, shopping)
- Monitor basic wellbeing data (hydration, medication reminders)
- Export reports for budgeting or medical logs

## 🚨 Real-world Problems Addressed

| Problem | Why It Matters | How We Address It |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Lack of Financial Transparency in Households** | Families often don't track shared expenses. This causes stress and surprise bills. | Our app allows all members to log transactions and view the collective family budget in real time. |
| **Elderly family members can’t use complex finance or health tracking apps** | Many banking or medical apps are too complicated or require internet or phone verification. | Our app is offline-first, desktop-based with large UI components and reminders. |
| **Families struggle with assigning and tracking daily tasks** | Tasks like grocery shopping or house cleaning often fall on one person. | Our shared task module lets each member view, complete, and get credit for daily household tasks. |
| **No unified app to combine finance, health, and task tracking** | Using multiple apps is confusing, especially for older users. | We combine budgeting, scheduling, and health tracking into one family-focused interface. |
